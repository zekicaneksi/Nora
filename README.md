"Pick up your sister" note warns the user by glowing repeatedly.

"Home" field also warns the user by glowing indicating there is a note in that field that requires attending also.

By default, on sign up, users have only one field that named "Home". Users can recursively create fields within fields.

Clicking a note's options button opens a popup which ables you to make the item glow (must be attended option).

By using must be attended option and reccuring option simultaneously, you can make the item warn you with intervals starting at a specific date. Interval frequency is stated in minutes, ie: 1440 -> a day.

### Reccuring Notes

In the picture, an example recurring item with attending option set to true is shown. The number in the beginning shows how many times the interval has passed from the last check. Clicking on the check button counts the note as done and stops it from glowing until the next interval.
